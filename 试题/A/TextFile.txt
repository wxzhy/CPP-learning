THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF TAKING A WALK THAT DAY. WE HAD BEEN WANDERING, INDEED, IN THE LEAFLESS SHRUBBERY AN HOUR IN THE MORNING; BUT SINCE DINNER (MRS. REED, WHEN THERE WAS NO COMPANY, DINED EARLY) THE COLD WINTER WIND HAD BROUGHT WITH IT CLOUDS SO SOMBRE, AND A RAIN SO PENETRATING, THAT FURTHER OUTDOOR EXERCISE WAS NOW OUT OF THE QUESTION. I WAS GLAD OF IT: I NEVER LIKED LONG WALKS, ESPECIALLY ON CHILLY AFTERNOONS: DREADFUL TO ME WAS THE COMING HOME IN THE RAW TWILIGHT, WITH NIPPED FINGERS AND TOES, AND A HEART SADDENED BY THE CHIDINGS OF BESSIE, THE NURSE, AND HUMBLED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MY PHYSICAL INFERIORITY TO ELIZA, JOHN, AND GEORGIANA REED. THE SAID ELIZA, JOHN, AND GEORGIANA WERE NOW CLUSTERED ROUND THEIR MAMA IN THE DRAWING-ROOM: SHE LAY RECLINED ON A SOFA BY THE FIRESIDE, AND WITH HER DARLINGS ABOUT HER (FOR THE TIME NEITHER QUARRELLING NOR CRYING) LOOKED PERFECTLY HAPPY. ME, SHE HAD DISPENSED FROM JOINING THE GROUP; SAYING, 'SHE REGRETTED TO BE UNDER THE NECESSITY OF KEEPING ME AT A DISTANCE; BUT THAT UNTIL SHE HEARD FROM BESSIE, AND COULD DISCOVER BY HER OWN OBSERVATION, THAT I WAS ENDEAVOURING IN GOOD EARNEST TO ACQUIRE A MORE SOCIABLE AND CHILDLIKE DISPOSITION, A MORE ATTRACTIVE AND SPRIGHTLY MANNER- SOMETHING LIGHTER, FRANKER, MORE NATURAL, AS IT WERE- SHE REALLY MUST EXCLUDE ME FROM PRIVILEGES INTENDED ONLY FOR CONTENTED, HAPPY, LITTLE CHILDREN.I RESISTED ALL THE WAY: A NEW THING FOR ME, AND A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH GREATLY STRENGTHENED THE BAD OPINION BESSIE AND MISS ABBOT WERE DISPOSED TO ENTERTAIN OF ME. THE FACT IS, I WAS A TRIFLE BESIDE MYSELF; OR RATHER OUT OF MYSELF, AS THE FRENCH WOULD SAY: I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT A MOMENT'S MUTINY HAD ALREADY RENDERED ME LIABLE TO STRANGE PENALTIES, AND, LIKE ANY OTHER REBEL SLAVE, I FELT RESOLVED, IN MY DESPERATION, TO GO ALL LENGTHS.
